            <h4>2. Spawn by Staff in Office server: each staff member can spawn 1 world boss per day.</h4>
            <h4>3. Spawn by player: players can spawn world boss by using boss coins (available in Patreon shop, coming soon).</h4>

            <h2>Reward:</h2>
            <h3>Players will receive rewards if they deal more than 0.5% of the boss's health.</h3>

            <h3>The top 1 damage dealer will receive additional rewards (high chance to get exclusive Pokémon, items + x5 coins, and extra normal items).</h3>
            <h3>The player who spawns the world boss also receives the same extra rewards as the top damage dealer (if spawned by a player or staff).</h3>
            <h3>You will receive 1-6 rewards from the following list (the more damage you deal, the more rewards you get):</h3>
            <div class="note">
                <h3>*Note: You can only receive rewards if you deal at least 0.5% of the boss's health.</h3>

            <h2>How the boss fight works:</h2>
            <h3>The world boss battle will start 5 minutes before it spawns (you can check the countdown in the worldboss channel in the Office Server).</h3>
            <h3>Players need to register in the Office Server but can battle the boss anywhere.</h3>
            <h3>Players can battle the boss by using ";wb fight" anywhere Pokemeow bot is available.</h3>
            <h3>You can battle the boss multiple times with no limit until the boss is defeated (15s cooldown after each match starts from when you lose).</h3>
            <h3>All charge recharge moves attack immediately.</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="note">
            <h3>*Note: Boss only has a small chance to attack you (higher if you use golden Pokémon) and you always move first. The boss is immune to Stealth Rock and status effects (burn, freeze, etc.). You CANNOT SWAP Pokémon DURING BATTLE, SO CHOOSE THEIR POSITIONS CAREFULLY. You need to be quick because the boss dies really quickly (like after 1-2 minutes), so good luck on grinding, meow!!!</h3>

            <h2>Guild for each boss (my edition, not the best team):</h2>
            <p>Here's a strategy to leverage speed and minimize the boss's attacks for easier victories:</p>
            
            <div class="guild-strategy">
                <h3>Strategy Overview:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Utilize the 1st Pokémon as a debuffer to apply maximum debuffs. For example, Golden Wooper with Focus Sash spamming Acid Spray works well. Since your team moves first, Golden Wooper can typically land 2 Acid Spray attacks, reducing the boss's Special Defense by 4 stages.</li>
                    <li>For other Pokémon, focus on high Attack IVs (speed is less critical since you move first) and choose moves that counter the boss's strategies. For instance, Gmax Gengar can use Future Sight effectively.</li>
                    <li>Choose items wisely: opt for a Choice item to maximize damage output or a Sash for survivability.</li>
